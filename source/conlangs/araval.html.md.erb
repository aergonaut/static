## Introduction

Araval was the language of the Aravalian Empire, which ruled the Ecašean river valley and is the ancestor of the modern Kingdom of Ciran, Sele, Benhu, Hroth, and many other states of the Plain today. In additon to dominating nearly the entierty of the Lénara (Ar. *laenara*), the Empire at its height stretched across the Gorondé mountains and into western Nanoc.

### The Aravali

The langauge derives from proto-Northern, the language of the Northern peoples who, beginning around -360 NL, began a mass migration from their homeland in the steppes of Egnon into the Ecašean and Ngakkoran valleys to the south and north.

Of the peoples that went south the Ecašean, the Aravali were perhaps the most dominant, if not the most sophisticated of the tribes. There, the Aravali encountered the Dottiri peoples, a pre-existing civilization that had developed along the banks of the Ecas river. Over time, the Dottiri were slowly absorbed by the Aravali, and indeed have had a lasting impact on Aravalian language, culture, and society. Those clans that were not absorbed were slowly pushed out of the Lénara, and would eventually settle on a large island off the coast of Cormu delta.

### Dialects

At its height, the Empire stretched across nearly half the continent and had more than 56 million citizens within its borders. Consequently, the spoken language became highly dialectized.

In general, there were three major dialectal areas:

* **Central**, spoken in the area around the capital Delon and also by most cities along the Ecas river
* **Southern**, spoken by the older cities to the south and east of the Ecas
* **Western**, largely spoken in the newer provinces to the west of the Ecas, and over the Gorondé mountains in Nanoc.

In the Classical period, scholarly grammarians began to push back against the rapid shift in spoken forms by publishing authoritative grammars in an attempt to "fix" perceived perversions of the language. This form of Classical Araval is what is largely attested in the written sources we have access to today, and what most authors of the Late and Post-Classical periods aspired to. We have scant few examples of common speech, mostly in the form of personal letters and journals, or country characters or other commoners in plays.

The form of the language described here is that of the Classical period as it would have been spoken in Delon.

## Phonology

### Consonants

|:--------------|:---------|:---------|:----------|:---------|
|               | *Labial* | *Dental* | *Palatal* | *Velar*  |
| *Nasal*       | **m**    | **n**    |           |          |
| *Stop*        | **p, b** | **t, d** |           | **c, g** |
| *Fricative*   | **f, v** | **s, z** | **h**     | **x**    |
| *Approximant* |          | **r**    |           |          |
| *Lateral*     |          | **l**    |           |          |

**t** and **d** are always dental. **c** and **g** are always hard, never soft.

The stops **p**, **t**, and **c** are lightly aspirated. **b**, **d**, and **g** are fully voiced.

In Central, **r** is usually an approximant; a tapped or trilled realization was more common in Southern dialects.

**l** is never dark, even in final position.

Even in the Classical period, **h** and **x** tended to only have their correct realization word-initially. In all other positions they were weakened to a glottal fricative.
