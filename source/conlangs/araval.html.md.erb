## Introduction

Araval was the language of the Aravalian Empire, which ruled the Ecašean river valley and is the ancestor of the modern Kingdom of Ciran, Sele, Benhu, Hroth, and many other states of the Plain today. In additon to dominating nearly the entierty of the Lénara (Ar. *laenara*), the Empire at its height stretched across the Gorondé mountains and into western Nanoc.

### The Aravali

The langauge derives from proto-Northern, the language of the Northern peoples who, beginning around -360 NL, began a mass migration from their homeland in the steppes of Egnon into the Ecašean and Ngakkoran valleys to the south and north.

Of the peoples that went south the Ecašean, the Aravali were perhaps the most dominant, if not the most sophisticated of the tribes. There, the Aravali encountered the Dottiri peoples, a pre-existing civilization that had developed along the banks of the Ecas river. Over time, the Dottiri were slowly absorbed by the Aravali, and indeed have had a lasting impact on Aravalian language, culture, and society. Those clans that were not absorbed were slowly pushed out of the Lénara, and would eventually settle on a large island off the coast of Cormu delta.

### Dialects

At its height, the Empire stretched across nearly half the continent and had more than 56 million citizens within its borders. Consequently, the spoken language became highly dialectized.

In general, there were three major dialectal areas:

* **Central**, spoken in the area around the capital Delon and also by most cities along the Ecas river
* **Southern**, spoken by the older cities to the south and east of the Ecas
* **Western**, largely spoken in the newer provinces to the west of the Ecas, and over the Gorondé mountains in Nanoc.

In the Classical period, scholarly grammarians began to push back against the rapid shift in spoken forms by publishing authoritative grammars in an attempt to "fix" perceived perversions of the language. This form of Classical Araval is what is largely attested in the written sources we have access to today, and what most authors of the Late and Post-Classical periods aspired to. We have scant few examples of common speech, mostly in the form of personal letters and journals, or country characters or other commoners in plays.

The form of the language described here is that of the Classical period as it would have been spoken in Delon.

## Phonology

### Consonants

|:--------------|:---------|:---------|:----------|:---------|
|               | *Labial* | *Dental* | *Palatal* | *Velar*  |
| *Nasal*       | **m**    | **n**    |           |          |
| *Stop*        | **p, b** | **t, d** |           | **c, g** |
| *Fricative*   | **f, v** | **s, z** | **h**     | **x**    |
| *Approximant* |          | **r**    |           |          |
| *Lateral*     |          | **l**    |           |          |

**t** and **d** are always dental. **c** and **g** are always hard, never soft.

The stops **p**, **t**, and **c** are lightly aspirated. **b**, **d**, and **g** are fully voiced.

In Central, **r** is usually an approximant; a tapped or trilled realization was more common in Southern dialects.

**l** is never dark, even in final position.

Even in the Classical period, **h** and **x** tended to only have their correct realization word-initially. In all other positions they were weakened to a glottal fricative.

### Vowels

|:-------|:---------|:---------|:---------|
|        | *Front*  | *Center* | *Back*   |
| *High* | **i, ī** |          | **u, ū** |
| *Mid*  | **e, ē** |          | **o, ō** |
| *Low*  |          | **a, ā** |          |

The pronunciation of **i**, **u**, and **a** is straightforward.

**e** and **o** are pronounced open (as in *bet* and *got*) in open syllables and in syllables ending in a **m**, **n**, **r** or **l**; and pronounced closed (as in *bait* or *goat*) elsewhere.

Each of the vowels can also be pronounced long. There is no quality distinction, only length. In general, the long vowels are pronounced approximately twice as long as the short vowels. In monosyllables, this may be increased to as much as three times as long.

### Stress

Stress in Araval is regular and is therefore not indicated in orthography. The stress is placed according to the following rules:

1. If the word has only two syllables, the penultimate syllable is stressed.
2. If the last three syllables contain any long vowels, stress the syllable with a long vowel that is furthest from the end.
3. If the last three syllables contain any closed syllables, stress the closed syllable furthest from the end.
4. If the last three syllables do not contain closed syllables or syllables with long vowels, stress the antepenultimate.

### Phonological constraints

In general Araval favors a simple CVC syllable structure.

Acceptable initial clusters:

* [**p**, **t**] + **t**
* [**f**, **s**] + **t**
* [**b**, **d**, **g**] + [**r**, **l**]
* **s** + [**p**, **t**, **c**]
* **mn**

Acceptable final clusters:

* **n** + [**t**, **d**, **c**, **g**]
* **m** + [**p**, **b**]
* [**r**, **l**] + [**b**, **d**, **g**]
* **s** + [**p**, **t**, **c**]

## Verbal Morphology

The Araval verb is inflected for two moods, three persons, two numbers, three tenses.

### The infinitive

Infinitives end in either **-ar**, **-en**, or **-ec**. A verb's infinitive ending determines various properties of its conjugation, most importantly which personal endings it takes.

Removing the infinitive ending gives the verb stem, which is the basis for many other verb forms.

### The indicative

#### The present

The present is formed from the addition of the personal endings to the verb stem.

|:---|:------------|:-------------|:---------
|    | **dumar**   | **mnesen**   | **loxec**
| 1s | **dum-au**  | **mnes-eu**  | **lox-iu**
| 2s | **dum-ao**  | **mnes-eo**  | **lox-io**
| 3s | **dum-as**  | **mens-es**  | **lox-is**
| 1p | **dum-ans** | **mnes-ens** | **lox-ins**
| 2p | **dum-ats** | **mnes-ets** | **lox-its**
| 3p | **dum-ant** | **mnes-ent** | **lox-int**

Each conjugation has a *thematic vowel* which is present in all forms.

* **-ar**: **a**
* **-en**: **u**
* **-ec**: **i**

#### The past

The past is formed by first adding the suffix **-et** to the verb stem and then attaching the personal endings.

|:---|:------------|:-------------|:---------
|    | **dumar**   | **mnesen**   | **loxec**
| 1s | **dum-et-au**  | **mnes-et-eu**  | **lox-et-iu**
| 2s | **dum-et-ao**  | **mnes-et-eo**  | **lox-et-io**
| 3s | **dum-et-as**  | **mens-et-es**  | **lox-et-is**
| 1p | **dum-et-ans** | **mnes-et-ens** | **lox-et-ins**
| 2p | **dum-et-ats** | **mnes-et-ets** | **lox-et-its**
| 3p | **dum-et-ant** | **mnes-et-ent** | **lox-et-int**

#### The future

The future is formed similarly to the past, with the suffix **-er** for **-ar** verbs and **-em** for **-en** and **-ec** verbs.

|:---|:------------|:-------------|:---------
|    | **dumar**   | **mnesen**   | **loxec**
| 1s | **dum-er-au**  | **mnes-em-eu**  | **lox-em-iu**
| 2s | **dum-er-ao**  | **mnes-em-eo**  | **lox-em-io**
| 3s | **dum-er-as**  | **mens-em-es**  | **lox-em-is**
| 1p | **dum-er-ans** | **mnes-em-ens** | **lox-em-ins**
| 2p | **dum-er-ats** | **mnes-em-ets** | **lox-em-its**
| 3p | **dum-er-ant** | **mnes-em-ent** | **lox-em-int**

### The irrealis

The irrealis uses a different set of personal endings but the same stems for the three tenses. The forms are summarized below. 

|:---|:-------------|:--------------|:---------
|    | **dumar**    | **mnesen**    | **loxec**
| *Present* |||
| 1s | **dum-ia**   | **mnes-io**   | **lox-iu**
| 2s | **dum-asi**  | **mnes-osi**  | **lox-usi**
| 3s | **dum-ias**  | **mens-ios**  | **lox-ius**
| 1p | **dum-ami**  | **mnes-omi**  | **lox-umi**
| 2p | **dum-asti** | **mnes-osti** | **lox-usti**
| 3p | **dum-ani**  | **mnes-oni**  | **lox-uni**
| *Past* |||
| 1s | **dum-et-ia**   | **mnes-et-io**   | **lox-et-iu**
| 2s | **dum-et-asi**  | **mnes-et-osi**  | **lox-et-usi**
| 3s | **dum-et-ias**  | **mens-et-ios**  | **lox-et-ius**
| 1p | **dum-et-ami**  | **mnes-et-omi**  | **lox-et-umi**
| 2p | **dum-et-asti** | **mnes-et-osti** | **lox-et-usti**
| 3p | **dum-et-ani**  | **mnes-et-oni**  | **lox-et-uni**
| *Future* |||
| 1s | **dum-er-ia**   | **mnes-em-io**   | **lox-em-iu**
| 2s | **dum-er-asi**  | **mnes-em-osi**  | **lox-em-usi**
| 3s | **dum-er-ias**  | **mens-em-ios**  | **lox-em-ius**
| 1p | **dum-er-ami**  | **mnes-em-omi**  | **lox-em-umi**
| 2p | **dum-er-asti** | **mnes-em-osti** | **lox-em-usti**
| 3p | **dum-er-ani**  | **mnes-em-oni**  | **lox-em-uni**

### Participles

Formation of participles in Araval follows standard derivational processes using the derivational ending **-ibes** attached to the present, past, or future root. Mood is not indicated in the participles.

|:------|:-------------|:--------------|:---------
|       | **dumar**    | **mnesen**    | **loxec**
| Pres. | **dum-ibes** | **mnes-ibes** | **lox-ibes**
| Past  | **dum-et-ibes** | **mnes-et-ibes** | **lox-et-ibes**
| Fut.  | **dum-er-ibes** | **mnes-em-ibes** | **lox-em-ibes**

### Irregular verbs

#### 'To be'

The verb **esen** 'to be' is irregular in Araval.

|:-------|:---------|:---------|:--------
| *Ind.* | *Pres.*  | *Past*   | *Fut.*
| 1s     | **eu**   | **fuau** | **ereu**
| 2s     | **eo**   | **fuō**  | **ereo**
| 3s     | **es**   | **fus**  | **eres**
| 1p     | **sins** | **funs** | **erins**
| 2p     | **sits** | **futs** | **erits**
| 3p     | **sint** | **funt** | **erint**
| *Irr.* | *Pres.*  | *Past*   | *Fut.*
| 1s     | **siu**   | **futia** | **seriu**
| 2s     | **susi**   | **futasi**  | **serusi**
| 3s     | **sius**   | **futias**  | **serius**
| 1p     | **sumi** | **futami** | **serumi**
| 2p     | **susti** | **futasti** | **serusti**
| 3p     | **suni** | **futani** | **seruni**

The following can be observed from the paradigms above:

* **esen** has three suppletive stems
  * **-** (blank), used in the present and future indicative
  * **fu-**, used in the past
  * **s-**, used in the present and future irrealis
* Though its infinitive is in **-en** it behaves as an **-ar** verb in the past, and an **-ec** verb in the present and future irrealis

## Nominal morphology

### Gender

Nouns have three genders: masculine, feminine, and neuter.
