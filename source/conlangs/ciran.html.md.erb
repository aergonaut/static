title: A Grammar of Ciran

# <%= current_page.data.title %>

Ciran— called *é goveša* ‘the Speech’ by its speakers— is the language of about 55 million people in the Aravalian Plain in the northern hemisphere of Erea. It is the official language of the Kingdom of Ciran, as well as in Delon, Carmina, Ždol, and many other Aravalian states. It is also widely spoken in many areas of Fareo and the Garganaš.

Ciran is heavily dialectalized, with regional variants being found in each Cirani province and in each state. The standard language under Cirani law, and the literary language of much of the Plain, is the **Medine** dialect, the dialect of the capital Ciran City.

Besides Medine, only two other dialects have literary significance: **Ášle**, the dialect spoken in Ášla, due to the importance of the city in printing and performing arts; and **Delone**, the dialect of Delon, the former imperial capital. Neither of these is strikingly different than Mezine, and in written form they are almost indistinguishable. The more divergent dialects are largely rural and unwritten.

# Phonology

## Consonants

|                 | Labial   | Dental   | Palatal  | Velar    |
|-----------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| **Nasal**       | **m**    | **n**    |          |          |
| **Stop**        | **p, b** | **t, d** |          | **c, g** |
| **Fricative**   | **f, v** | **s, z** | **š, ž** |          |
| **Approximant** |          | **r**    |          |          |
| **Lateral**     |          | **l**    |          |          |

### Allophonic variation

**r** has several allophones depending on dialect. Medine speech tends to favor that of a lateral, non-retroflex approximant, while Ašle favors an uvular approximant. Delone and several rural dialects have an alveolar trill instead.

## Vowels

|          | Front    | Center   | Back   |
|----------|----------|:--------:|-------:|
| **High** | **i, ü** |          | **u**  |
| **Mid**  | **e, ö** |          | **o**  |
| **Low**  |          | **a**    |        |

All vowels are pronounced clear and distinct. Medine dialect does not have diphthongs, though in rapid speech **ai, au, ei, ou** tend to diphthongize.

There is no length distinction, though there is a slight quality distinction. **e** and **o** in open syllables tend to be pronounced more open, while in closed syllables they tend to be pronounced more closed. When stressed, either implicitly or when explicitly marked (**é, ó**), these vowels also tend to be pronounced more open.

## Stress

Stress regularly falls on the penultimate syllable. Irregular stress is marked with an accent.

## Phonological constraints

Broadly, Medine has a regular CVC syllable structure.

Acceptable initial clusters:

* any voiceless fricative + **t**: **ft, st, št**
* any voiced stop or fricative + **l, r**: **gl**, **dr**, **vr**
* **s** + **f, v, n, m**
* **t, f** + **s**
* **mn**

Acceptable final clusters:

* any voiceless stop + **s**: **ps**, **ts**
* **l, r** + any voiced stop or fricative: **lv**, **rž**
* any nasal + any voiced stop of the same articulation: **mb**, **nd**, **ng**, \***mg**

Examples: **fseg-da, žro-vle**

# Nominal Morphology

## Number

Ciran expresses two numbers: singular, and plural. These operate as expected.

## Gender

Ciran is inflected for two genders: masculine (**óme**) and feminine (**žene**). 

* Masculine nouns end in **-o, -u, -a**, or a consonant, take masculine adjectives, and use the **ír** pronoun.
* Feminine nouns end in **-a, -i**, or a consonant, take feminine adjectives, and use the **íre** pronounc.

As is evident from the list above, nouns in **-a** or a consonant are ambiguous. In practice, these can usually be disambiguated by the genitive singular.

For the most part, gender is an arbitrary classification of nouns based on declensional forms, and there is little significance attached to the gender of a word: trees (**ama**, f.) are not seen as "more feminine" than hills (**tul**, m.) simply due to the grammatical gender of the words.

### Occupational titles

In Old Ciran, many occupational titles had gender-specific versions which were used in accordance with the biological gender of the referent.

In most cases, the root word is masculine and a feminine form is derived from it by removing any final vowel and replacing it with **-a**: **maréžo** 'shepherd', **maréža** 'shepherdess'.

In modern speech, these gender-specific forms have fallen out of use, and it is now considered correct to use the root word for all referents, regardless of sex.

The exception to this is with noble titles, which retain separate forms for different genders: **éran** 'king', **tira** 'queen'; **saž** 'prince', **zivresa** 'princess'.

### Animals

In general, there are three nouns that can refer to an animal: one for males, one for females, and a category term. If the category term is not available, the masculine term is used instead.

## Case

Nouns are inflected for four cases: nominative, accusative, genitive, and dative. For many nouns, the nominative and accusative singular are identical; additionally, there has been much leveling in the plural forms.

### Principal parts

In order to fully disambiguate a noun, both the nominative singular and the genitive singular are required, due to ambiguities in the nominative. These two forms are refered to as the principal parts, and are listed in the dictionary definition of every noun.

Thus a dictionary entry might look like the following:

> **mona, -i** (*n.*) - word

### Nominative case

| Masculine |       |       | Feminine |      |      |
|-----------|-------|-------|----------|------|------|
|           | s.    | pl.   |          | s.   | pl.  |
| **cir**   | cir   | cira  | **ela**  | ela  | elo  |
| **rauno** | rauno | rauna | **cor**  | cor  | coré |
| **pozu**  | pozu  | poza  | **feli** | feli | felé |
| **mona**  | mona  | mono  |          |      |      |

### Accusative case

| Masculine |       |       | Feminine |      |      |
|-----------|-------|-------|----------|------|------|
|           | s.    | pl.   |          | s.   | pl.  |
| **cir**   | ciro  | cira  | **ela**  | ela  | elo  |
| **rauno** | rauno | rauna | **cor**  | core | cora |
| **pozu**  | pozu  | poza  | **feli** | feli | fela |
| **mona**  | mona  | mono  |          |      |      |

The accusative case is almost entirely identical to the nominative case. The exception is in instances where a final vowel was lost due to sound change.

The Araval accusative was formed with final *-m*. This sound was lost, likely due to nasalization, but guarded final vowels from also being lost due to sound change.

### Genitive case

| Masculine |       |       | Feminine |      |      |
|-----------|-------|-------|----------|------|------|
|           | s.    | pl.   |          | s.   | pl.  |
| **cir**   | ciri  | cire  | **ela**  | ele  | ele  |
| **rauno** | rauni | raune | **cor**  | core | core |
| **pozu**  | pozi  | poze  | **feli** | fele | fele |
| **mona**  | moni  | mone  |          |      |      |

The genitive case shows significant leveling across all forms, especially in the feminine where all forms are identical.

Historically, the genitive in Araval was formed with *-i*. This caused significant vowel change in the transition to Old Ciran, which was simplified as that language evolved into modern Ciran.

### Dative case

| Masculine |        |        | Feminine |       |       |
|-----------|--------|--------|----------|-------|-------|
|           | s.     | pl.    |          | s.    | pl.   |
| **cir**   | ciron  | ciran  | **ela**  | elan  | elen  |
| **rauno** | raunon | raunan | **cor**  | coren | coren |
| **pozu**  | pozun  | pozan  | **feli** | felin | felen |
| **mona**  | monan  | monon  |          |       |       |

The dative has a very similar form to the nominative, but with the added **-n** ending. This ending caused some fronting in the vowels of the feminine, which combined with leveling and analogy, produced the present forms.
