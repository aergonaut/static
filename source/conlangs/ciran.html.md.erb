title: A Grammar of Ciran
---
# <%= current_page.data.title %>

Ciran— called *noa goveša* ‘the Speech’ by its speakers— is the language of about 55 million people in the Aravalian Plain in the northern hemisphere of Erea. It is the official language of the Kingdom of Ciran, as well as in Delon, Carmina, Ždol, and many other Aravalian states. It is also widely spoken in many areas of Fareo and the Garganaš.

Ciran is heavily dialectalized, with regional variants being found in each Cirani province and in each state. The standard language under Cirani law, and the literary language of much of the Plain, is the **Medine** dialect, the dialect of the capital Ciran City.

Besides Medine, only two other dialects have literary significance: **Ášle**, the dialect spoken in Ášla, due to the importance of the city in printing and performing arts; and **Delone**, the dialect of Delon, the former imperial capital. Neither of these is strikingly different than Medine, and in written form they are almost indistinguishable. The more divergent dialects are largely rural and unwritten.

# Phonology

## Consonants

|                 | Labial   | Dental   | Palatal  | Velar    |
|-----------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| **Nasal**       | **m**    | **n**    |          |          |
| **Stop**        | **p, b** | **t, d** |          | **c, g** |
| **Fricative**   | **f, v** | **s, z** | **š, ž** |          |
| **Approximant** |          | **r**    |          |          |
| **Lateral**     |          | **l**    |          |          |

### Allophonic variation

**r** has several allophones depending on dialect. Medine speech tends to favor that of a lateral, non-retroflex approximant, while Ašle favors an uvular approximant. Delone and several rural dialects have an alveolar trill instead.

## Vowels

|          | Front    | Center   | Back   |
|----------|----------|:--------:|-------:|
| **High** | **i, ü** |          | **u**  |
| **Mid**  | **e, ö** |          | **o**  |
| **Low**  |          | **a**    |        |

All vowels are pronounced clear and distinct. Medine dialect does not have diphthongs, though in rapid speech **ai, au, ei, ou** tend to diphthongize.

There is no length distinction, though there is a slight quality distinction. **e** and **o** in open syllables tend to be pronounced more open, while in closed syllables they tend to be pronounced more closed. When stressed, either implicitly or when explicitly marked (**é, ó**), these vowels also tend to be pronounced more open.

## Stress

Stress regularly falls on the penultimate syllable. Irregular stress is marked with an accent.

## Phonological constraints

Broadly, Medine has a regular CVC syllable structure.

Acceptable initial clusters:

* any voiceless fricative + **t**: **ft, st, št**
* any voiced stop or fricative + **l, r**: **gl**, **dr**, **vr**
* **s** + **f, v, n, m**
* **t, f** + **s**
* **mn**

Acceptable final clusters:

* any voiceless stop + **s**: **ps**, **ts**
* **l, r** + any voiced stop or fricative: **lv**, **rž**
* any nasal + any voiced stop of the same articulation: **mb**, **nd**, **ng**, \***mg**

Examples: **fseg-da, žro-vle**

# Verbal Morphology

The Ciran verb is heavily inflected for person, number, mood, and tense.

## Present (**éron**)

|         | **govar** | **luven** | **mnesir** |
|---------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| I.s.    | govao     | luvo      | mnesai     |
| II.s.   | goveo     | luveu     | mnesei     |
| III.s.  | gove      | luve      | mnese      |
| I.pl.   | govon     | luvun     | mnesen     |
| II.pl.  | govoš     | luvoš     | mneseš     |
| III.pl. | govu      | luvu      | mnesü      |

In the **-ar** conjugation, verbs with stems ending in **-c** or **-g** change to **-š** or **-ž**, respectively, in the II.s. and III.s:

* **pocar** 'to drift': **pocao, pošeo, poše, pocon, pocoš, pocu**
* **legar** 'to read': **legao, ležeo, leže, legon, legoš, legu**

In the **-en** conjugation, verbs with stems ending in **-š** or **-ž** change to **-c** or **-g**, respectively, in the I.s., II.pl., and III.pl. In the **-ir** conjugation, the same shift happens, but only in the I.s:

* **sešen** 'to dry': **seco, sešeu, seše, secun, secoš, secu**
* **nežir** 'to sleep': **negai, nežei, neže, nežen, nežeš, nežü**

Historically, these alternations are the result of sound change from Araval. Where Araval had *legeo*, sound change caused the *g* to shift to **ž**, producing the modern form **ležeo**.

Interestingly, Old Ciran showed a tendency to generalize these irregular shifts, rather than eliminate them, so that verbs fitting the candidate pattern were altered, even though they may not have been subject to the original sound change that motivated the alternation.

For example, **tašir** 'to break' has I.s. form **tacai** even though the Araval form is actually *tatsir* with I.s. *tatsai* which should have yielded \***tašai** following the correct sound changes.

Some verbs have irregular stems:

* **esar** 'to be': **ao, eo, e, son, soš, su**
* **far** 'to do': **fassao, fasseo, faš, fasson, fassoš, fassu**

## Past

The past is formed from the present by infixing the final letter of the infinitive between the verb stem and the personal endings.

|         | **govar** | **luven** | **mnesir** |
|---------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| I.s.    | govrao    | lummo     | mnešrai    |
| II.s.   | govreo    | lummeu    | mnešrei    |
| III.s.  | govre     | lumme     | mnešre     |
| I.pl.   | govron    | lummun    | mnešren    |
| II.pl.  | govroš    | lummoš    | mnešreš    |
| III.pl. | govru     | lummu     | mnešrü     |

Due to sound change, there are a number of root alternations that occur when forming the past tense forms:

In **-ar** and **-ir**:

* \***tr**, \***sr** &rarr; **šr**, \***dr**, \***zr** &rarr; **žr**
* \***pr** &rarr; **fr**
* \***br** &rarr; **vr**
* \***lr**, \***rr** &rarr; **dr**

In **-en**:

* \***tn**, \***cn** &rarr; **sn**, \***dn**, \***gn** &rarr; **žn**
* \***bn**, \***pn**, \***mn** &rarr; **mm**

Additionally, a number of verbs use irregular verb stems in the past:

* **esar** 'to be': **fuao, fueo, fue, fuon, fuoš, fu**

## Past anterior

The past anterior is formed by inserting **-ec-** into the past tense forms, after the past infix.

|         | **govar**   | **luven**   | **mnesir**   |
|---------|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| I.s.    | govrecao    | lummeco     | mnešrecai    |
| II.s.   | govrešeo    | lummešeu    | mnešrešei    |
| III.s.  | govreše     | lummeše     | mnešreše     |
| I.pl.   | govrecon    | lummecun    | mnešrešen    |
| II.pl.  | govrecoš    | lummecoš    | mnešrešeš    |
| III.pl. | govrecu     | lummecu     | mnešrecü     |

The same root alternations that occur in the present tense for roots ending in **-c** occur in the past anterior when the **-ec-** infix is inserted.

* **esar** 'to be': **fucao, fušeo, fuš, fucon, fucoš, fucu**

## Future

The future is formed by infixing **-et-** into the present tense forms.

|         | **govar**   | **luven**   | **mnesir**   |
|---------|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| I.s.    | govetao     | luveto      | mnesetai     |
| II.s.   | goveteo     | luveteu     | mnesetei     |
| III.s.  | govete      | luvete      | mnesete      |
| I.pl.   | goveton     | luvetun     | mneseten     |
| II.pl.  | govetoš     | luvetoš     | mneseteš     |
| III.pl. | govetu      | luvetu      | mnesetü      |

* **esar** 'to be': **sedo, sede, se, seton, setoš, setu**

# Nominal Morphology

## Number

Ciran expresses two numbers: singular, and plural. These operate as expected.

## Gender

Ciran is inflected for two genders: masculine (**óme**) and feminine (**žene**). 

* Masculine nouns end in **-o, -u, -a**, or a consonant, take masculine adjectives, and use the **ír** pronoun.
* Feminine nouns end in **-a, -i**, or a consonant, take feminine adjectives, and use the **íre** pronounc.

As is evident from the list above, nouns in **-a** or a consonant are ambiguous. In practice, these can usually be disambiguated by the genitive singular.

For the most part, gender is an arbitrary classification of nouns based on declensional forms, and there is little significance attached to the gender of a word: trees (**ama**, f.) are not seen as "more feminine" than hills (**tul**, m.) simply due to the grammatical gender of the words.

### Occupational titles

In Old Ciran, many occupational titles had gender-specific versions which were used in accordance with the biological gender of the referent.

In most cases, the root word is masculine and a feminine form is derived from it by removing any final vowel and replacing it with **-a**: **maréžo** 'shepherd', **maréža** 'shepherdess'.

In modern speech, these gender-specific forms have fallen out of use, and it is now considered correct to use the root word for all referents, regardless of sex.

The exception to this is with noble titles, which retain separate forms for different genders: **éran** 'king', **tira** 'queen'; **saž** 'prince', **zivresa** 'princess'.

### Animals

In general, there are three nouns that can refer to an animal: one for males, one for females, and a category term. If the category term is not available, the masculine term is used instead.

## Case

Nouns are inflected for four cases: nominative, accusative, genitive, and dative. For many nouns, the nominative and accusative singular are identical; additionally, there has been much leveling in the plural forms.

### Principal parts

In order to fully disambiguate a noun, both the nominative singular and the genitive singular are required, due to ambiguities in the nominative. These two forms are refered to as the principal parts, and are listed in the dictionary definition of every noun.

Thus a dictionary entry might look like the following:

> **mona, -i** (*n.*) - word

### Nominative case

| Masculine |       |       | Feminine |      |      |
|-----------|-------|-------|----------|------|------|
|           | s.    | pl.   |          | s.   | pl.  |
| **cir**   | cir   | cira  | **ela**  | ela  | elo  |
| **rauno** | rauno | rauna | **cor**  | cor  | coré |
| **pozu**  | pozu  | poza  | **feli** | feli | felé |
| **mona**  | mona  | mono  |          |      |      |

### Accusative case

| Masculine |       |       | Feminine |      |      |
|-----------|-------|-------|----------|------|------|
|           | s.    | pl.   |          | s.   | pl.  |
| **cir**   | ciro  | cira  | **ela**  | ela  | elo  |
| **rauno** | rauno | rauna | **cor**  | core | cora |
| **pozu**  | pozu  | poza  | **feli** | feli | fela |
| **mona**  | mona  | mono  |          |      |      |

The accusative case is almost entirely identical to the nominative case. The exception is in instances where a final vowel was lost due to sound change.

The Araval accusative was formed with final *-m*. This sound was lost, likely due to nasalization, but guarded final vowels from also being lost due to sound change.

### Genitive case

| Masculine |       |       | Feminine |      |      |
|-----------|-------|-------|----------|------|------|
|           | s.    | pl.   |          | s.   | pl.  |
| **cir**   | ciri  | cire  | **ela**  | ele  | ele  |
| **rauno** | rauni | raune | **cor**  | core | core |
| **pozu**  | pozi  | poze  | **feli** | fele | fele |
| **mona**  | moni  | mone  |          |      |      |

The genitive case shows significant leveling across all forms, especially in the feminine where all forms are identical.

Historically, the genitive in Araval was formed with *-i*. This caused significant vowel change in the transition to Old Ciran, which was simplified as that language evolved into modern Ciran.

### Dative case

| Masculine |        |        | Feminine |       |       |
|-----------|--------|--------|----------|-------|-------|
|           | s.     | pl.    |          | s.    | pl.   |
| **cir**   | ciron  | ciran  | **ela**  | elan  | elen  |
| **rauno** | raunon | raunan | **cor**  | coren | coren |
| **pozu**  | pozun  | pozan  | **feli** | felin | felen |
| **mona**  | monan  | monon  |          |       |       |

The dative has a very similar form to the nominative, but with the added **-n** ending. This ending caused some fronting in the vowels of the feminine, which combined with leveling and analogy, produced the present forms.

# Adjectival morphology

For the most part, adjectives are declined like nouns with the same ending.

Each adjective has separate forms for each of the two genders. Depending on the set of endings used, an adjective may belong to one of four declensions:

* I: consonant, **-a*
* II: **-e**, **-i**
* III: **-u**, **-ü**
* IV: **-o**, **-ö**

The forms are summarized below:

|        | I   |     | II  |     | III |     | IV  |     |
|--------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
|        | m.  | f.  | m.  | f.  | m.  | f.  | m.  | f.  |
| s.nom. | -   | -a  | -e  | -i  | -u  | -ü  | -o  | -ö  |
| s.acc. | -o  | -a  | -e  | -e  | -u  | -e  | -o  | -e  |
| s.gen. | -i  | -e  | -i  | -e  | -i  | -e  | -i  | -e  |
| s.dat. | -on | -an | -en | -in | -un | -en | -on | -en |
| p.nom. | -a  | -o  | -a  | -é  | -a  | -é  | -a  | -é  |
| p.acc. | -a  | -o  | -a  | -a  | -a  | -a  | -a  | -a  |
| p.gen. | -e  | -e  | -e  | -e  | -e  | -e  | -e  | -e  |
| p.dat. | -an | -en | -en | -en | -on | -en | -an | -en |

# Articles

The definite article is **no** 'the'. Historically, the article derives from the Araval demonstrative *nox*, an intensive used to emphasize the proximal relationship of the noun to the speaker.

|      | Masc. |     | Fem. |     |
|------|-------|-----|------|-----|
|      | s.    | pl. | s.   | pl. |
| nom. | no    | noa | noa  | nou |
| acc. | no    | noa | noa  | nou |
| gen. | noe   | noe | noe  | noe |
| dat. | nan   | nen | nan  | nen |

While many forms are orthographically nearly identical, the spread of phonetic forms is even narrower, and in rapid speech, only one or two distinct forms may surface.

# Pronouns

## Personal pronouns

The personal prounouns are:

|         | Nom.    | Acc.    | Gen.    | Dat.     |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|----------|
| I       | **ca**  | **ca**  | **cai** | **can**  |
| you (s) | **šö**  | **šö**  | **šoi** | **šön**  |
| he      | **ir**  | **iro** | **iri** | **iron** |
| she     | **ira** | **ira** | **ire** | **iran** |
| it      | **eo**  | **eo**  | **ei**  | **eon**  |
| we      | **to**  | **to**  | **toi** | **ton**  |
| you (p) | **žde** | **žde** | **ždi** | **žden** |
| they    | **ea**  | **ea**  | **eai** | **ean**  |

## Demonstrative pronouns

Ciran has only one set of demonstrative pronouns, lacking the distinction between near and far referents.

|         | Nom.    | Acc.    | Gen.    | Dat.     |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|----------|
| that    | **aro** | **aro** | **ari** | **aron** |
| these   | **ara** | **ara** | **are** | **aran** |

## Interrogative pronouns

|         | Nom.     | Acc.     | Gen.     | Dat.      |
|---------|----------|----------|----------|-----------|
| who (s) | **še**   | **še**   | **šei**  | **šen**   |
| who (p) | **šu**   | **šu**   | **šü**   | **šun**   |
| when    | **šero** | **šero** | **šere** | **šeron** |
| where   | **ševo** | **ševo** | **ševe** | **ševon** |

**šedül** 'why' and **šema** 'how' are invariant.

# The use of the verb

## Tense usage

There are four separate conceptual times of action: the far past, the past, the present, and the future. These correspond to the past anterior, the past, the present, and the future tenses.

> **Amona óta e frosna üla vrežna štažreše.**  
> *Long ago a great, tall tree stood in the old forest.*

> **E medinan cuman ftonren.**  
> *We rode into the city yesterday.*

> **Mažra žue züma mate!**  
> *Mother is cooking tomato soup!*
